# ðŸŽ¶ Spotify Listening History Data Analytics Project

This project explores and analyzes my Spotify listening history using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and **Tableau**. The goal is to clean, process, and visualize listening patterns to uncover insights about my music habits.

## ðŸ”§ Methods & Workflow

**Jupyter Notebook (Python):**

* Imported & explored the dataset (`spotify_history.csv`).
* Cleaned data: handled missing values, converted timestamps, added new features (year, month, day, hour).
* Converted `ms_played` into minutes/seconds.
* Filtered out short plays (< 15s) to remove accidental clicks.
* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Top artists & tracks by total minutes played
  * Listening habits by hour of the day
  * Platform usage (web, mobile, etc.)
  * Skip behavior analysis
  * Album listening trends
* Visualizations created in Python:

  * **Bar Chart** â€“ Top 10 Artists
  * **Heatmap** â€“ Listening by day & hour
  * **Pie Chart** â€“ Platform usage
  * **Bar Chart** â€“ Top skipped songs
  * **Line Graph** â€“ Album listening trends

**Tableau Project:**

* Built dashboards with:

  * Heatmap of listening trends
  * Treemap of top artists & songs
* Tableau Public link: [Spotify History Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ameer.sulyans2376/viz/Spotify_History_Project/Dashboard)

* **Most Skipped Artist:**
  The **Beatles** were skipped the most.

* **Platform Usage:**
  **Android** was used significantly more than Windows, Web Player, iOS, or Cast to Device.

* **Top 10 Albums by Listening Time:**

  * ðŸŽµ *The New Abnormal* (The Strokes) was the most played album.
  * ðŸŽµ The Beatles followed as the second most played.

* **Top Artists:**

  * ðŸŽ¤ The **Beatles** were the most listened-to artist.
